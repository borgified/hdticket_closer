bookmarklet for filling out forms to reduce number of clicks to close a helpdesk ticket

recently our company decided to go with salesforce/bmc helpdesk ticketing solution. there are many places to click in order to successfully "close" a ticket (closed by, time spent, ticket status, etc). this bookmarklet populates required fields with generic info so that tickets can be closed less painfully.
