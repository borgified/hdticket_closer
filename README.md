bookmarklet for filling out forms to reduce number of clicks to close a helpdesk ticket

recently our company decided to go with salesforce/bmc helpdesk ticketing solution. there are many places to click in order to successfully "close" a ticket (closed by, time spent, ticket status, etc). this bookmarklet populates required fields with generic info so that tickets can be closed less painfully.


1. drag the customized link (bookmarklet) below to your bookmarks bar
2. edit an incident (ticket)
3. click on bookmarklet in your bookmarks toolbar to populate required fields
4. click save in ticket
